# UK-global-sector

As part of 1st task I have a created a simple dashboard to show Covid cases in UK. For the 2nd task I have done sentimental analysis on a car review data and even predicted whether review is bad or not.

To run the files,
1st task - Doesnt require any external files to be added. Just run the .ipynb file using any IDE.
2nd task - Please download car_reviews.csv file and later run the .ipynb file.
